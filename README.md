# 🎰 Domain Machine

A platform built on Doma Protocol that gamifies domain trading with fixed-price mystery boxes, offering random domains scored from 0-100 and driving higher engagement for sellers.

## ✨ Motivation

In today’s market, many domain owners hold hundreds or even thousands of domains, but struggle to sell them efficiently.

On the other side, buyers are looking for affordable, high-potential domains. In the crypto space especially, buyers enjoy the thrill of discovery — the chance to find hidden gems at a low cost.

Meanwhile, the Doma Protocol is focused on increasing transaction volume and reducing asymmetry for both sellers and buyers.

That’s why we decided to create this platform.
