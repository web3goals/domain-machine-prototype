# 🎰 Domain Machine

A platform built on Doma Protocol that gamifies domain trading with fixed-price mystery boxes, offering random domains scored from 0-100 and driving higher engagement for sellers.

## ✨ Motivation

In today’s market, many domain owners hold hundreds or even thousands of domains, but struggle to sell them efficiently.

On the other side, buyers are looking for affordable, high-potential domains. In the crypto space especially, buyers enjoy the thrill of discovery — the chance to find hidden gems at a low cost.

Meanwhile, the Doma Protocol is focused on increasing transaction volume and reducing asymmetry for both sellers and buyers.

That’s why we decided to create this platform.

## 🛠️ How it works

### 📋 Listing

- A seller tokenizes domains on D3 Protocol and lists them in the app.
- Each domain loads from Doma Subgraph and gets a score (0-100) based on Moz DA, Ahrefs DR, and Semrush Authority.

### 🎰 Buying

- A buyer pays 0.003 WETH to open mystery boxes and receive a random domain.
- A buyer can make 0.0015 WETH offers on domains they want to purchase.
- A seller accepts offers through Doma Marketplace and receives payment.

### 🎁 Rewards

- Daily treasury distributions reward sellers based on their sold domains' scores.
- A seller can track their rewards history in the app.
